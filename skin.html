                  Aloe vera is commonly known as a topical gel used to <b>treat sunburn.</b> Promisingly, it may also provide other health benefits, largely due to its 
                  antioxidant properties. Preliminary research has indicated that aloe vera may benefit your <b>skin, dental, oral, and digestive health.</b> It may even 
                  improve blood sugar control. The Aloe vera plant has been used for thousands of years to heal a variety of conditions, most notably burns, wounds, 
                  skin irritations, and constipation.

                  For growing aloe indoors, place in bright, indirect sunlight. For growing outdoors, ensure aloe is lightly shaded to protect it during the hottest 
                  times of the day. Covered patios and porches are great places to grow aloe during warm seasons. Plant in fast-draining Miracle-Gro Cactus, Palm & 
                  Citrus Potting Mix. The ingredients of the gel-like plant juice have a widely proven positive effect on our skin. If you want to harvest Aloe vera,
                   it is best to use two- to three-year-old plants and cut the leaves at the base of the stems with a clean, sharp knife.

                  Nettles are definitely the best in spring when they are young and tender. Cut them early on as soon as they get 6 or 8-inches tall; 
                  this is a perfect spring tonic and delicious, nutritious food. Then harvest them a second time in late spring–most sources recommend
                  harvesting only the tops which are the most tender.

                     All roses grow best in full sun with moist, well-drained soil rich in organic matter. However, even  when planted against a 
                     north wall (meaning no direct sunlight) roses can still perform well. Roses prefer slightly acidic soil (6-7 pH). The best time to harvest 
                     rose petals is mid-summer. Collect the petals on a dry morning. Gently pull off the petals, leaving behind the calyx of 
                     the rose. Dry on a tray in a warm, airy room or at a low heat (about 34°C/93°F) in a food dehydrator.
